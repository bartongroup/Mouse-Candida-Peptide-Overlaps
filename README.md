# JCA_PepOverlap

## Identification of intersection of tryptic peptides between Candida albicans and M. musculus

Small project for Simon Arthur to identify the proportion of peptides in a combined Candida/Mouse MS proteomics experiment which can be unambiguously attributed to a specific protein from either organism.

See [the HTML report](Candida_Mouse_Peptide_Overlaps.html) for details...

The work was carried out in a Jupyter notebook. The conda environment used to carry out the analysis can be recreated from [conda_environment.yaml](conda_environment.yaml)
